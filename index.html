                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/beth.png" alt="">
                            <p>I collaborated with UBC philosophy professor, Leslie Burkholder, and multiple students to create BETH Tableau -- a desktop application which aids in the creation and analysis of semantic tableaux. I am personally responsible for the core functionality of the application, which was to detect contradictions in proporisional/predicate logic statements and allow branches of a tableau to be opened (signifying a truth) or closed (signifying a falsehood) based on the existnce of contradictions. I implemented two different modes of contradiciton analysis: interpreted mode which incorporates user-inputted predicate contradictions and basic mode which defines a contradiction to exist only between a predicate and its negation.</p>
                            <p>The above image is a screenshot of a tableau that I made in BETH. We started out with premises 1a, 2a, 3a and 4a and eventually found a set of true facts using two disjunctions and closing two branches. The rightmost branch signifies the set of true statements that we can derive from the given premises.

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/evolution.png" alt="">
                            <p>I'm in the process of writing a genetic algorithm to train a topologically evolving neural network to play Cops n' Robbers, an Android game that I built a few months ago. To do this I had to port my Java implementation of the game into Python's pygame -- because I felt that it would be easier to write the genetic algorithm in Python.</p>
                            <p>I have completed porting the game over and the creation/evaluation of the neural network. I also have implemented methods of identifying well performing genomes to be given greater priority when it comes to evolution. I still have to figure out how to actually <strong>evolve</strong> the neural network -- but I expect to be finished by the end of October.

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Extracting Duplicates from a Dirty Dataset</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/data.png" alt="">
                            <p>This project was done as part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Conference hosted by the University of Waterloo. We were tasked with identifying duplicate entries in a resource description framework dataset which had a high collection of errors/incorrectly entered attributes. I, along with two others, designed an algorithm which worked better than a naive pairwise comarision (note: this was to be run on datasets of over 300,000 entries). Our algorithm blocked on equal valued predicates (linear time) then did a naive comparison within the set of entities that had at least one matching value. Since we discarded all buckets which were larger than the square root of the cardinality of the set of entities that contained the specific predicate, the pairwise comparison was never too expensive.</p>
<p>To actually compare two entities to each other, we handled the three main types of attributes independently. Strings were compared with Levenshtein edit distance, Integers were comapred with edit distance and percent difference, Dates were compared with edit distance and date distance (ie. how long from one date to the other).</p>
<p>Given that this project was completed over the course of 6 hours at a conference, we didn't have the opportunity to implement a significant number of our ideas. One such idea, which would give a quasi-linear solution, was to use locality sensitive hashing along with K-nearest neighbour matching, to find "roughly similar" entities. We would then use supervised learning with human labelling or unsupervised learning with a match-distance comparison algorithm. (ie. if two entities are close to each other, but far from everything else, they're most likely duplicates).</p>

<p>So far I've written a generative recursion/backtracking search algorithm that produces a list of valid schedules for a given set of courses.

			    <p>As part of a team of five developers, during nwHacks (a 36 hour hackathon), I built PickAPlaceForUs, an Android application which assists ggroups of users in choosing an optimal place to eat. I indepdently implemented the retrieval of data from the Google Maps API, Google Places API and Yelp API. I then implemented the code to display the retrieved data in an auto-completing search bar."
			    <p>I also designed the algorithm, which worked by asking groups of users (ie. everyone that was planning on attending) to vote (using proportion based selection) between two places. This allowed us, in the typical fashion of a greedy algorithm, to repeatedly find locally optimal solutions until we eventually arived at a globally optimal location. We chose to use proportion based selection (ie. instead of choosing one place or the other, each user distributes 100 points between two places) to tackle the fact that even if location preferences are transitive for a specific user, they will not necessarily be transitive for the entire group. We required the transitivity of the group's choices to be a base fact, to allow a greedy algorithm to work appropriately.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/zero.jpg" alt="">
			    <p>As part of a team of three developers, during DubHacks (a 24 hour hackathon), I built Zero, a Django based application that aggregates news articles relevant to a user query and applies a custom built summarization algorithm on the aggregated content to obtain a sufficiently comphrenensive summary of the recent news relevant to the given query.</p>
			    <p>My main contribution to the project was the design and implementation of the algorithm, which I did fairly independently. The algorithm is an extractive summarization algorithm that identifies a number of summarizing sentences in an article, based on a <strong> relevance score </strong>, calculated using a number of <strong>features</strong> (as identified through research done by others), and a <strong>centrality score</strong>, which is determined by applying <strong>PageRank</strong> on a graph with the vertices being sentences and the edges being the <strong>cosine-similarities</strong> of the <strong>tf-idf vectorizations</strong> of each sentence. A <strong>maximal marginal relevance</strong> algorithm is applied to the most summarizing sentences to ensure that we don't provide duplicate/overlapping information to the user.

<p>Bounce is a location-based social network with posts that literally spread around the world<p>
<p>Over the course of 24 hours at nwHacks 2016, I and four other developers built a location-based social media app where the posts you see change based on where you are. You see posts that were posted around you, and you can "bounce" them to help them spread further across the world. The posts you see are either posted by people near you or spread from far away by people who thought it was funny, interesting, or worth sharing in general.</p>
<p>We used React Native to build the iOS app. We used Node.js for the backend, hosted on Azure. We also created a web application to allow users to use Bounce in the browser. Additionally, we built desktop applications for Linux, Windows and OSX, using electron.js.</p>
